Click on an API in order to see more information on it and to subscribe to it. Only after subscribing, you will get an API key which enables you to actually call the API.

Here you can add custom text and generic information on your APIs, and it will appear on the `/apis` page. As the selection of APIs may depend on the groups a user belongs to, you should perhaps not assume you can refer to specific APIs, as long as they are not publicly visible.
